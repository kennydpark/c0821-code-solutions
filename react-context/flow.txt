User can sign up.
  - The input fields page is rendered and depending on what the action prop is, the href and text content for appropriate rendered elements.
  - When the user enters a username and password into the input field, the data is stored in the state of the AuthForm component
  - Submitting the form triggers the client sends a request to the server to input a new user into the database
  - A condition is checked whether the username exists in the database or not
  - if it does not, it inserts it into the database with a query using SQL
  - the username is added with a hashedPassword created as well

User can sign in.
  - Once the user has succesfully signed up, signing in requires an authentication
  - The user receives a token that is unique to that account and is needed to sign in
  - The authentication is checked via fetch request and returns a match for the username and password
  - Signing in sends the token back to the server so that the server can verify it

User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page).
  - The client sends a message containing the token that pertains to the username
  - the token is stored in the localStorage of the app and the state of the App class is updated to contain the information about the user
  - if the token returns null when decoded, the authorizing property in the state is set to false.
  - componentDidMount runs one time to check if there's a token or token was decoded.
  - if check is successful, the state is set to correct user info.
  - The correct view is rendered for staying sign in.

User can sign out.
  - The token property is removed from the localStorage
  - The state of class App is updated to set user property to null
  - The home page is rendered for signing up/in.
